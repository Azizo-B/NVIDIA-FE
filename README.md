# NVIDIA FE Bot: A Journey of Automation and Passion

This project was more than just an automated script, it marked the beginning of my path in tech. Created during 2020, the code has been left unrefactored and untouched to preserve the state in which it was originally built. It serves as a personal snapshot of where I started as a developer, highlighting the learning process and growth that followed.

At its core, it was built to track the availability of highly sought-after NVIDIA graphics cards. Like many, I faced the frustration of waiting endlessly for restocks. I knew there had to be a more efficient way, and I decided to take matters into my own hands.

The bot scrapes the NVIDIA's partner site and checks for product availability, then sends real-time alerts through Discord when restocks happen. It even automates the checkout process to secure the grapics card before anyone else could.
Looking back now, I obviously see that the code is far from great, it’s messy and unoptimized, as this was really at the very beginning of my journey in **2020**. I didn’t fully understand the implications of web scraping or the ethical considerations involved, but despite its flaws, it was functional and marked the start of something much bigger for me.

But this project became more than just a tool. Each challenge, every bug, exception and race condition taught me something new. This journey pushed me to learn Python, and without it, I don’t know if I would have chosen my current career path. It demanded creativity, persistence, and the eagerness to adapt in real time. This was the project that sparked my passion for software development. It showed me the power of automation, the beauty of creating solutions to real problems, and the thrill of watching code come to life.

Today, I look back at it with immense pride. It stands as a testament to the curiosity that ignited my love for coding and the journey that has since followed. To me, this project represents much more than just a script, it is the beginning of my career, the foundation of my skills, and a constant reminder of how far I've come.
